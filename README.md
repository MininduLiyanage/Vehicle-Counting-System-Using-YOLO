# Vehicle-Counting-System-Using-YOLO
This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to count vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes) in a lane from video footage. The system is designed to accurately detect and count various types of vehicles, providing real-time insights into traffic flow and congestion.

## model
This project utilizes a YOLO-based object detection model, YOLOv8-L (Large) to detect vehicles.

## dependencies
The sort module is used to track vehicles. It is a simple online and real-time tracking algorithm for 2D multiple object tracking in video sequences. It can be downloaded from this repository. https://github.com/abewley/sort
