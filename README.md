# Vehicle-Counting-System-Using-YOLO
This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to count vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes) in a lane from video footage. The system is designed to accurately detect and count various types of vehicles, providing real-time insights into traffic flow and congestion.
